<h2>My Story</h2>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="parapad">
My name is Michael C. Calhoun. I'm a systems analyst from Manhattan,
KS. I grew up in Northeastern Pennsylvania, in the Poconos Mountains. I
lived in a small town called Jim Thorpe, PA. I joined the U.S Army when
I was 17 and went to Ft. Jackson S.C. for my Basic Combat Training, and
then to Ft. Gordon Georgia for my Advanced Individual Training in radio
and satellite operation and maintenance.<a class="twitter-timeline" data-dnt="true" href="https://twitter.com/Mikey_Calhoun" data-widget-id="420241731703947264">Tweets by @Mikey_Calhoun</a>

My first duty station was Fort Riley, KS. I served with the 1st
Infantry Division's Combat Aviation Brigade. I worked for the brigade's
IT Help Desk, serving in such roles as;
network security administrator and systems administration. While on
Active Duty I was able to study independently to attain several IT
certifications such as CompTIA A+ and Security+, and Microsoft
Certified Technology Specialist. I was also able to attain my Associates of
Science degree in Computer Science, graduating as a Phi Theta Kappa
honor graduate. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="parapad">I was awarded a slot in the Kansas
State Army ROTC Green to Gold program in December 2012 to train to become an United States Army
Officer. I currently serve as a Lead Information Technology Consultant
at Kansas State University's Information Technology Assistance Center.
